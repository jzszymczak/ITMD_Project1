  <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my first functioning website. This is a part of the first project for my ITMD-361 class</p>
  <h3>A little introduction</h3>
  <p>My name is Jakub, I am a second year ITM major that wants to get into the co-terminal program. I want to focus mainly on coding application to eventually become a software engineer. Currently I am only focusing on school, but after this class I hope to start working on my own personal website so I can add it to my porfolio in the search for future internships. </p>
  <p>Recently I built my sister her first computer which has the following specs: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intel Core i5-13400</li>
    <li>MSI PRO Z790 A-MAX</li>
    <li>Corsair Vengeance 32GB RAM</li>
    <li>EVGA FTW3 ULTRA GAMING GeForce RTX 3070</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I also built my current computer that I am making this website from, but it is 6 years outdated and is due for an upgrade</p>
