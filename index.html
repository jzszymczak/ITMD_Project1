  <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my first functioning website. This is a part of the first project for my ITMD-361 class.</p>
  <h3>A little introduction</h3>
  <p>My name is Jakub, I am a second year ITM major that wants to get into the co-terminal program. I want to focus mainly on coding application to eventually become a software engineer. Currently I am only focusing on school, but after this class I hope to start working on my own personal website so I can add it to my porfolio in the search for future internships. </p>
