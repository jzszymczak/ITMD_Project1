    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Jakub and I like to spend my free time bouldering, play games, and watching anime</p>
    <p>I've been climbing for around a year now and can do most V4s and currently I'm working my way up to V5s. Below are two videos of my recent V5 climbs.</p>

    <p>I also like to play games with my friends, mostly multiplayer and competitive games. I've been into Marvel Rivals and Rocket League recently and have achieved Grandmaster rank in Marvel Rivals and Champion 2 in Rocket League.</p>

    <p>Another thing I like to do is watch anime and read manga, which I spent a fairly long time doing. Watched over 300 anime so far. Here are a few of my favorites</p>
